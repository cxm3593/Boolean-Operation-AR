		<h1>Boolean Operation for modeling in AR/VR environment | CSCI 716</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			In traditional modeling softwares like Maya,
			users work with a flat screen but when 3D positions are projected
			into a 2D screen, the sense of depth is lost in the process.
			Modeling with XR devices provide an advantage by viewing models
			in a 3d environment. 
			There are existing VR modeling applications
			so this project aims to build a prototype for 3D modeling in 
			AR environment.
		</p>
		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use boolean operation algorithm for 3d modelling in an 
				AR/VR environment.
			</li>
			<li>
				Target platform is magic leap.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Since magic leap is not very stable. A fallback
						option would be Oculus.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The user can observe a 3D model and edit it by grabbing 
				another object and intersecting them together.
			</li>
			<li>
				The intersection will invoke boolean operation algorithm
				and then modify the target object.
			</li>
			<li>
				Final presentation will have a video demo and a short slide
				presentation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>How to modify 3d mesh in Unreal at run time?</b></li>
				<p>
					Epic geometry team developed a plugin to do it, it is
					called <b>Geometry Processing Plugin</b>. It is a little
					complicated to use this plugin because we need to compile 
					an unreal editor with the plugin from source code. 
					But the plugin is also very powerful. It provides a 
					complete framework for geometry editing at run time.
				</p>
				<li>
					<b>How to implement boolean operation in 3D?</b>
				<p>
					Boolean operation is derived from map overlapping
					algorithm which connected to plane sweep algorithm.
					Text book Computational Geometry by Mark de Berg covers
					a 2D version of it. A challenge will be extending it
					for an extra dimension.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>How to do it in AR/VR?</b>
				<p>
					Magic Leap works with unreal 4. It provides a SDK for 
					developing AR applications.
					But magic leap is not very stable. So a backup plan is
					to use SteamVR or Oculus VR for Oculus development.
				</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Weekly Plan</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Week 6 & Week7: Setting up the project</li>
			<li>Week 8: Mesh editing at runtime</li>
			<li>Week 9: 3D Boolean Operation</li>
			<li>Week 10: Debugging with a flat screen environment.</li>
			<li>Week 11: Integrating into AR environment.</li>
			<li>Week 12: Installing AR control, object anchor</li>
			<li>Week 13: Improvements on rendering and modeling experience 
				/ (Fallback to Oculus in the worst case)</li>
			<li>Week 14: Final debugging 
				/ (Fallback to Oculus in the worst case)</li>
			<li>Week 15: In-class final project presentations</li>
		</ul>
